# It's Quiz Time!

## Description
Office Superfans are abundant, but quizes that truly test superfans' cability are few and far between. The [Office Superfan quiz](https://brigantinojoe.github.io/quiz/) will challenge your Office series knowledge and will save your scores to compete with other superfans! After watching the series over and over, I decided to create this quiz for others who have done the same. 

I learned quite a bit of Javascript this project including, but not limited to:
- Manipulating existing HTML elements. Specifically using the display style to hide and unhide certain elements.
- Adding Event Listeners for the various types of HTML buttons
- Using dynamic CSS to apply CSS to the new elements created in the Javascript functions.
- Using intervals to create timers that can be changed and saved as a final score.
